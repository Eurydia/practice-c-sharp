# Stormy days

The organizers of a sailing competition measured the speed of wind for N days at Balaton-
füred. 
A sailing competition should not be held in smooth winds, nor in stormy winds. 
In a storm, the speed of wind is more than 100 km/h. 
There is only one round each day of the competition, and there are K rounds.

Write a program that counts how many days the wind was stormy.

## Input
The frst line of the standard input contains the count of days (1≤N≤100) and the
competition days (1≤K≤10). The next N lines contain the speed of wind of each day
(1≤S≤200).

## Output

The frst line of the standard output should contain the count of days with a storm.
