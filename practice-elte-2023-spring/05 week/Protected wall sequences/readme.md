# Protected Wall Sequences

There are N guarding posts on the Great Wall of China.
However, there are only M posts where there are guards.
We call a wall between two posts protected if the posts on each end have guards.
A protected wall sequence is a non-expandable sequence of protected walls.

Write a program that gives the count of protected wall sequences.

## Input

The frst line of the standard input contains the count of posts (1≤N≤100) and the count of posts with guards (1≤M≤100) separated by a space.
The next M lines contain the ID of a post where there are guards.
There is at most one guard on each post.

## Output

The frst line of the standard output should contain the count of protected wall sequences.
